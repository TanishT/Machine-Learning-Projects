A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]
B = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1]
% Initialize constant s 
s = 2

% See how element-wise addition works
add_AB = A + B 

% See how element-wise subtraction works
sub_AB = A - B

% See how scalar multiplication works
mult_As = A * s

% Divide A by s
div_As = A / s

% What happens if we have a Matrix + scalar?
add_As = A + s
